- [ ] Why would you use class component over function components (removing hooks from the question)?
    
    Function components can be easier to read and understand because they are stateless functions. Their use will also force you to separate your component functions differently so that some might be reuseable.

- [ ] Name three lifecycle methods and their purposes.

     1) constructor - gives the class component access to inherited methods via the super constructor
     2) render - renders the components visual elements
     3) componentDidMount - initializes state and perform any other tasks that need to happen immediately after a component is mounted.

- [ ] What is the purpose of a custom hook?

    A custom hook allows you to write dryer code by reusing a function or series of functions that have been abstracted out of the components and called where needed.

    User experience can be crushed by buggy apps and at the end of the day UX is the motivator behind what we do.
